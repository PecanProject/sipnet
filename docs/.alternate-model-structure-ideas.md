#### Wood Maintenance Respiration

$$
R_m = K_w C_W Q_{10}^{\frac{(T_{\text{air}} - 0)}{10}} \tag{A19}\label{eq:A19}
$$

Wood maintenance respiration ($R_m$) depends on the wood carbon content ($C_W$), a scaling constant ($K_w$), and the $Q_{10}$ factor for temperature sensitivity.

#### Heterotrophic Respiration

$$
R_h = C_S K_h Q_{10}^{\frac{(T_{\text{soil}} - 0)}{10}} \left(\frac{W}{W_e}\right) \tag{A20}\label{eq:A20}
$$

Heterotrophic respiration ($R_h$) is a function of soil carbon content ($C_S$), a scaling factor ($K_h$), the $Q_{10}$ factor, and the ratio of soil moisture ($W$) to water holding capacity ($W_e$).

## Flooding

There are multiple options for representing flooding.

Set indicator variable to 1 if the site is a wetland, 0 otherwise. Then

1. if the site is a wetland, set the drainage to zero OR
2. increase the threshold above which water drains e.g.
 
ùêπdrainage= max(ùëäsoil ‚àí WHC, 0)

becomes

ùêπdrainage= max(ùëäsoil ‚àí k * WHC, 0)

K could be a fixed value like 2 or 10. Or a site level parameter if warranted (e.g. based on soil type, or to allow different flood irrigation depths).

F_\mathrm{CO_2} = F_\mathrm{CO_2}^\prime + R_\text{methox}
$$

Where $F^\prime$ is the flux $F$ prior to adding methane oxidation. 

Assuming a 1:1 ratio of $CH_4$ to $CO_2$ production.

* ebullition

## Nitrogen Fixation

In model-structure, all fixed N goes directly to the soil mineral N pool. This is an important simplifying assumption that will likely need to be revisited:
- For n fixing plants, most fixed N goes directly to the plant, not the soil. It will be more complicated to model this, as we will need to subtract this flux from plant N demand.

### Carbon Cost of N fixation

The carbon cost of N fixation is proportional to the rate of fixation $F_\text{n fix}$: 

$$
R_{A\text{nfix}} = K_\text{resp,nfix} \cdot F_\text{n fix}
$$

Then we need to update GPP:

$$
\text{GPP} = \text{GPP}^prime - R_{A\text{nfix}}
$$

Where $GPP^prime$ is GPP before adding the carbon cost of N fixation.

Alternatively, could divert a fraction of root exudates. 

### N fixation - Additions for Fixed Nitrogen Partitioning and Adjusted Plant Uptake

A new PFT-specific parameter, $f_{\text{N fix, plant}}$ represents the fraction of fixed N that is allocated directly to plant uptake.

**Total Fixed Nitrogen Flux**

First compute the total fixed nitrogen flux:

$$
F^N_\text{fix, total} = K_\text{fix} \cdot NPP  \cdot D_{\text{temp}}
\tag{19}\label{eq:n_fix_total}
$$

**Partitioning the Fixed Nitrogen Flux into plant N and soil mineral N**

Partition the total fixed N flux into two components:
- Direct allocation to plant uptake:
$$
F^N_\text{fix, plant} = f_{\text{N fix, plant}} \cdot F^N_\text{fix, total}
\tag{19a}\label{eq:n_fix_plant}
$$

- Allocation to the mineral nitrogen pool:

$$
F^N_\text{fix, min} = (1 - f_{\text{N fix, plant}}) \cdot F^N_\text{fix, total}
\tag{19b}\label{eq:n_fix_min}
$$

**Modified Mineral Nitrogen Balance**

The soil mineral nitrogen balance is updated to include only the $F^N_\text{fix, min}$ component from nitrogen fixation:
$$
\frac{dN_\text{min}}{{dt}} = 
  F^N_\text{litter,min} +
  F^N_\text{soil,min} +
  F^N_\text{fix, min} - 
  F^N_\text{fert,min} - 
  F^N_\mathrm{vol} - 
  F^N_\text{leach} - 
  F^N_\text{uptake, soil}
\tag{15}\label{eq:mineral_n_dndt}
$$

**Adjusted Plant Nitrogen Uptake**

Plant N demand is calculated as:
$$
\frac{dN_\text{plant}}{dt} = \sum_{i} \frac{dN_{\text{plant,i}}}{dt}
\tag{20}\label{eq:plant_n_demand}
$$

Since a fraction $ F^N_\text{fix, plant} $ is taken directly from fixation, the additional mineral N required from the soil is reduced accordingly. Define the soil mineral N uptake as:
$$
F^N_\text{uptake, soil} = \max\left( \frac{dN_\text{plant}}{dt} - F^N_\text{fix, plant}, \; 0 \right)
\tag{20a}\label{eq:plant_n_uptake}
$$

For N fixing plants, the direct uptake $ F^N_\text{fix, plant} $ is added to the plant N pool, and only the residual demand $ F^N_\text{uptake, soil} $ is met by drawing down the soil mineral N.


## Additional Moisture dependency functions $D_\text{water}$

### $D_\text{water}$ That Captures the Transition from Water to O2 Limited Metabolism (Yan et al 2018)

The formulation of Yan et al. (2018) is a piecewise function that transitions from moisture to O2 limited heterotrophic respiration.

Although originally applied to RH, the function can be adapted to other processes that are moisture and O2 dependent.

Equation 12 from Yan et al.:

$$
D_\text{water} = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{K_{W_\text{soil}} + W_{\text{soil,opt}}}{K_{W_\text{soil}} + W_\text{soil}} \left(\frac{W_\text{soil}}{W_{\text{soil,opt}}}\right)^{1 + a n_s}, & \text{if } W_\text{soil} < W_{\text{soil,opt}} \\[10pt]
\left(\frac{\phi - W_\text{soil}}{\phi - W_{\text{soil,opt}}}\right)^b, & \text{if } W_\text{soil} \geq W_{\text{soil,opt}}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:

- $W_\text{soil}$ is the soil moisture content.
- $W_\text{soil,opt}$ is the optimal moisture content where $R_H$ peaks.
- $\phi$ is the soil porosity, related to soil bulk density.
- $K_{W_\text{soil}}$ is a moisture constant reflecting the impact of moisture content on SOC desorption.
- $a$ is the SOC-microorganism collocation factor. Controls shape of limitation curve.
- $n_s$ is the saturation exponent affecting DOC diffusion.
- $b$ is the O2 supply restriction factor that controls the shape of the limitation curve associated with the decline in $R_H$ when moisture exceeds $W_\text{soil,opt}$.

When $W_\text{soil} < W_\text{soil,opt}$, moisture limits SOC availability, and $R_H$ slowly increases as moisture increases to $W_\text{soil,opt}$. When $W_\text{soil} \geq W_\text{soil,opt}$ oxygen availability limits $R_H$, which declines as moisture increases beyond $W_\text{soil,opt}$. 

The function captures the transition from a moisture-limited respiration rate (when soil moisture is low and SOC is the limiting factor) to an oxygen-limited respiration rate (when moisture exceeds $W_\text{soil,opt}$). The parameters $a$ and $b$ control the function's behavior in the respective regions of soil moisture.

### Multi-Pool

This was removed in https://github.com/PecanProject/sipnet/pull/125

It may be helpful to review that PR for context, where it was removed alongside soil quality.

After adding N, we can consider having turnover rates of multiple pools controlled by C:N dependnency function. 

Design ideas:
* Allow flexible number of pools 1 ... Inf (minimally 1- 3).
* Each soil carbon pool should turn over at a different rate.
* Carbon must transfer from one pool to the next slower pool.

* Reference PR #125 (removal of `SOIL_QUALITY` and `multipool`), but ignore soil quality and microbes logic.
* Add `n` additional soil carbon pools:

  * Assign different turnover rates per pool.
  * Should not introduce `n-1` new parameters like `baseSoilResp_i` ‚Äî instead, modify based on either C:N or some other f(n).
* Implement **carbon transfer between pools**, e.g.:

  * Pool 1 ‚Üí Pool 2
  * Pool 2 ‚Üí Pool 3
  * ...
  * Pool n-1 ‚Üí Pool n

Start without microbes for simplicity


### DAYCENT Moisture Formulation 

This function is already implemented in SIPNET.

When using the DAYCENT formulation, the moisture effect is calculated as follows:

$$
F_{\text{DAYCENT}}(W) = \left( \frac{W_{\text{soil}} / W_{\text{WHC}} - 1.7}{0.55 - 1.7} \right)^{e_{\text{DAYCENT}}} \cdot \left( \frac{W_{\text{soil}} / W_{\text{WHC}} + 0.007}{0.55 + 0.007} \right)^{3.22}
$$

Where:

- $W_{\text{soil}}$: Soil water content
- $W_{\text{WHC}}$: Soil water holding capacity
- $e_{\text{DAYCENT}}$: Exponent used in the DAYCENT formulation

This function uses an empirical relationship to calculate the moisture effect based on soil water content relative to the soil water holding capacity, with specific parameters hard-coded.

### Dependence of Anaerobic Metabolism Using Soil Moisture Content as a Proxy for $O_2$

#### Gaussian

Here $D_{\mathrm{f_{WHC}}}$ is modeled as a Gaussian function:

$$
D_{\mathrm{f_{WHC}}}= \exp\left(-\frac{(f_{WHC} - f_{WHC_\text{opt}})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Where:

- $f_{WHC_\text{opt}}$ is the optimal moisture content at which anaerobic metabolism peaks,
- $\sigma$ controls the width of the curve, reflecting how quickly anaerobic metabolism decreases on either side of $f_{WHC \text{opt}}$.

With respect to N2O, a literature review by Wang et al 2023 https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1110151 provides N2O flux along with  pH, bulk density, % clay, %SOC, total N, [NH4], [NO3], T, and water-filled pore space ($f_{WHC}$) as covariates.

Wang et al 2023 found that of pH, Bulk Density, Clay, SOC, Total N, NH4+ NO3- Temperature and $f_{WHC}$, only temperature and $f_{WHC}$ were significantly correlated with $F^N_\mathrm{N_2O}$.

Figures 6 in Wang et al 2023 suggests for a gaussian, $f_{WHC_\text{opt}}\simeq 80\%$ and $\sigma\simeq 10\%$. For any function used, it would be prudent to estimate parameters from the provided supplementary data.

### Beta

$$
D_{\text{moisture}} = (f_{WHC} - f_{WHC_\text{min}})^\beta \cdot (f_{WHC_\text{max}} - f_{WHC})^\gamma
$$

Where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are parameters that control the shape of the curve, and can be estimated for a particular maiximum and width.



#### Double Exponential

$$
D_{\text{moisture}} =
\begin{cases}
(1 - e^{-k(f_{WHC} - f_{WHC_\text{min}})}) & f_{WHC} \leq f_{WHC_\text{opt}} \\
e^{-k(t - f_{WHC_\text{opt}}} & f_{WHC} > f_{WHC_\text{opt}}
\end{cases}
$$

where:

* k is a rate constant
* $f_{WHC_\text{min}}$ is the minimum water-filled pore space for anaerobic metabolism
* $f_{WHC_\text{opt}}$ is the optimal water-filled pore space for anaerobic metabolism


#### Piecewise linear $D_{\text{water,anaer}}$

$$
D_\text{water} =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } f_{WHC} \leq 50 \\
\frac{f_{WHC} - 50}{45}, & \text{if } 50 < f_{WHC} \leq 95 \\
-\frac{f_{WHC} - 95}{15} + 1, & \text{if } 95 < f_{WHC} < 110 \\
0, & \text{if } f_{WHC} \geq 110
\end{cases}
$$

Where $f_{WHC}=W_{soil}/W_{WHC}$ is the fraction of water holding capacity.

### Summary of different functions of $D_\text{water,opt}$

Available data suggest that there are many functions that could represent the relationship between $f_{\text{WHC}}$ and fluxes from anaerobic metabolism. 

However, it is unlikely that available data will support the choice of one over others. A model with fewer parameters would be preferred, as would one that has some theoretical justification beyond shape. For example, 
Yan et al (2018) propose a $D_\text{water}$ function that captures the transition from water to oxygen limited metabolism.


Some options considered:

- Piecewise linear function
- Gaussian function (Wang et al 2023)
- Beta
- Double exponential function
- Double logistic function
- Adapt the parabolic $D_\text{temp, A}$ from SIPNET (Braswell et al 2005)

## Effect of SOM on Soil Water Dynamics

Note - almost certainly don't need this because the effect is small and the hydrology parameters (fraction of W>WHC that can be drained in a day) already account for SOM.

Ideas other than those below to try: make effect a function of % change in SOM rather than absolute amount. 

**SOM Effect on Water Holding Capacity**

To account for the influence of soil organic matter (SOM) on soil water holding capacity ($W_{\text{WHC}}$), we will use a saturating relationship:

$$
W_{\text{WHC}} = W_{\text{WHC,0}} \cdot \left( 1 + k_{\text{SOM}} \cdot \frac{C_{\text{SOM}}}{C_{\text{SOM}} + C_{\text{sat}}} \right)
$$

$W_{\text{WHC,0}}$ is the soil water holding capacity at zero SOM, $k_{\text{SOM}}$ is the sensitivity of WHC to SOM, $C_{\text{SOM}}$ is the soil organic matter content, and $C_{\text{sat}}$ is the soil organic matter content at which WHC is saturated.

_Note:_ This is based on Libohova et al. (2018), a synthesis of US soils data that reported relationships as the response of WHC as a volume fraction ($k_{\text{SOM,vol}$) with units of cm water / cm soil). To convert from %WHC to SIPNET units of cm water / 30cm soil it is necessary to multiply by the soil bulk density and soil depth:
$k_{\text{SOM,cm}} = k_{\text{SOM,vol}} \cdot \rho_b \cdot d$ where $\rho_b$ is soil bulk density and $d$ is soil depth. 

Libohova et al. (2018) suggests that $k_{\text{SOM,vol}}$ is ~ 1.5% change in WHC per 1% increase in SOC in sandy soils. In silty and clayey soils, the slope is ~ 0.6%. Assuming a bulk density of 1.3 g/cm^3 and a soil depth of 30 cm, this would correspond to $k_{\text{SOM,cm}}$ of 0.2 and 0.6 cm water / 30 cm soil, respectively.

##### SOM effect on Drainage Rate

The effect of SOM on the drainage rate  $f_{\text{drain}}$, is defined as the fraction of excess water drained per day, is adjusted as follows:


$$
f_{\text{drain}} = f_{\text{drain,0}} \cdot \exp\left( -k_{\text{SOM,drain}} \cdot C_{\text{SOM}} \right)
$$


Where $f_{\text{drain,0}}$ is the baseline drainage rate current model parameter, $k_{\text{SOM,drain}}$ is the coefficient controlling the sensitivity of drainage to SOM, and $C_{\text{SOM}}$ is the soil organic matter content. This is consistent with 


## Agronomic Events

### Tillage

The tillage adjustment term $\alpha_{\text{tillage}}$ is set to 1 by default, and can be changed for one month to a value provided in the `events.in` file.

Potential adjustments

- Set the time until \alpha_{\text{tillage}} is reset to 1
- Create an alternate tillage adjustement function that slowly decays back to 1 over time.
- More complex tillage functions that depend on implement, depth, and other factors. Currently not used because these factors are not detectable from remote sensing._{\text{WHC}
