# SIPNET Parameter Values and Origins

Notes and usage:
- The table below compiles SIPNET parameter names, mathematical notation, values used in key studies (Braswell 2005; Sacks 2006, 2007; Zobitz 2008, 2014, 2021), and .param files from the SIPNET test suite (niwot.param, russell_1.param) and PEcAn template (template.param).
- It is intended as a reference and provenance record—not as an exhaustive catalogue. Calibrated parameter posteriors from PEcAn (MCMC chains) are not included here; those are archived separately.
- Many entries duplicate across rows to preserve historical reporting; consider moving this wide table to an appendix or a downloadable CSV for readability and responsive rendering in HTML/PDF tables.

Deciduous stands: effectively ~0 (all wood persists) but some coarse litterfall ~3% yr⁻¹ for mature forests.

Niwot’s sparse coarse litterfall gave ~1.4% yr⁻¹. Posterior mean ~1% yr⁻¹ indicates very slow wood turnover (long-lived stems).                                        |
