# SIPNET Source Code Documentation
<!--This README is also used as the main page for Doxygen-generated documentation.-->

This document provides an overview of the SIPNET model source code.  

## Organization and Packages

[Redo this once we finish code reduction changes]

Organization strategy:
* SIPNET and common files each have their own directory

### Main program - SIPNET

[TODO: add some sort of description here, though it isn't clear what. Now that all extraneous code is gone (estimate, 
utilities), it is unclear what the purpose of this page is.]
