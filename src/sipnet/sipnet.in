! Input file to set up a forward run of SIPNET

! --- INPUTS FOR ALL RUN TYPES ---

RUNTYPE = standard
! RUNTYPE is obsolete; any value other than 'standard' will cause an error. It is
! retained (for now) to enable error reporting. This config is optional.

FILENAME = Sites/Niwot/niwot
! FILENAME.param is the file of parameter values & initial conditions
! FILENAME.param-spatial is the file of spatially-varying parameters
!  (first line must contain a single integer: # of locations)
! FILENAME.clim is the file of climate data for each time step

LOCATION = 0
! Location to run at (-1 means run at all locations)
! (If doing a sensitivity test or monte carlo run, location defaults to
!  0: can only do these types of runs at a single location)

DO_MAIN_OUTPUT = 1
! If 1, do the primary output to FILENAME.out (time series of all output
!  variables)
! If 0, suppress this output
! Ignored for montecarlo run with statsonly (treated as 1)

PRINT_HEADER = 0
! If 1, print header on main output file; if 0, don't print header
!  (default: 0)

DO_SINGLE_OUTPUTS = 0
! If 1, do extra outputs: one variable per file (e.g. FILENAME.NEE)
! If 0, don't do these extra outputs
! (These extra outputs are setup in sipnet.c : setupOutputItems)
! Ignored for montecarlo run with statsonly (treated as 0)
! For a spatial run (LOCATION = -1), with RUNTYPE = standard, the first
!  value on each line is the location, followed by the time series
! For RUNTYPE = senstest, the first value on each line is the parameter
!  value, followed by the time series
! For RUNTYPE = montecarlo, there is no leading label value - these
!  files just contain the time series
