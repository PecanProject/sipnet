  // When microbes are in effect, maintResp is the respiration term for the

  // seems fine).
  // However, when microbes are off, maintResp and rSoil are treated as the
  // same, which makes _some_ sense (and maintResp is calculated as
  // heterotrophic soil resp is described in [1]), but the use in the code is
  // confusing. Also, the description of maintResp (before this update) only
  // mentions the microbe case, furthering the confusion. For microbes off, I
  // would have expected maintResp to be 0, and rSoil to be calc'd as maintResp
  // is now.
  // The GROWTH_RESP flag may also play in here, as when that is on, we split
  // heterotrophic respiration into growth and maintenance resp. This means
  // maintResp and rSoil should not be the same (microbes off), so again -
  // confusing in the code. Also: are we handling all the permutations of
  // GROWTH_RESP and MICROBES correctly?
  // It's possible that better descriptions of these terms here, and more
  // comments in the code are all that is needed.
