## **SIPNET 1.0.0 - "SIPNET First Release"**

The first release of SIPNET reflected a series of improvements over the original SIPNET model (Braswell et al., 2005).
The model was developed by Bill Sacks and Dave Moore, with contributions from John Zobitz. The model was parameterized using data from the Harvard Forest flux tower using MCMC (Sacks et al., 2006).
The model was designed to simulate the carbon and water cycles of a forest ecosystem at half-daily time steps.


**Braswell et al. (2005)**

- Initial version of SIPNET.
- Half-daily time step with two vegetation carbon pools and one soil pool.
- MCMC parameter fitting with observations from Harvard forest flux tower.

**Sacks et al. (2006)**

- More complex water routine incorporating evaporation and snow pack.
- Evergreen leaf phenology.

**Sacks et al. (2007): "Better Respiration"**

- Shut down photosynthesis and foliar respiration when soil temperature < threshold.
- Partition autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration.
