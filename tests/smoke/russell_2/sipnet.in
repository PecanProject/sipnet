FILENAME = sipnet
! FILENAME.param is the file of parameter values & initial conditions
! FILENAME.clim is the file of climate data for each time step
! FILENAME must be a path relative to the directory in which SIPNET is run

DO_MAIN_OUTPUT = 1
! If 1, do the primary output to FILENAME.out (time series of all output
! variables)
! If 0, suppress this output

DO_SINGLE_OUTPUTS = 0
! If 1, do extra outputs: one variable per file (e.g. FILENAME.NEE)
! If 0, don't do these extra outputs

DUMP_CONFIG = 1
! NON DEFAULT
! If 1, print final config to FILENAME.config
! If 0, do not print the config

PRINT_HEADER = 1
! If 1, print header on main output and events.out files
! If 0, don't print header

QUIET = 0
! If 1, suppress info and warning messages generated during the SIPNET run
! If 0, do not suppress messages

!! MODEL OPTIONS !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EVENTS = 1
! Process events found in events.in

GDD = 1
! Use growing degree days to determine leaf growth

GROWTH_RESP = 0
! Explicitly model growth resp, rather than including with maint resp

LEAF_WATER = 0
! Calculate leaf pool and evaporate from that pool

LITTER_POOL = 0
! Enable litter pool in addition to single soil carbon pool

MICROBES = 0
! Enable microbe modeling

SNOW = 1
! Keep track of snowpack, rather than assuming all precipitation is liquid

SOIL_PHENOL = 0
! Use soil temperature to determine leaf growth

SOIL_QUALITY = 0
! Use soil quality submodel

WATER_HRESP = 1
! Whether soil moisture affects heterotrophic respiration

NUM_SOIL_CARBON_POOLS = 3
! NON DEFAULT
! Number of soil carbon pools to explicitly model
