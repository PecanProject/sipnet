These notes used to reside in the main README. They have been moved here pretty much verbatim, and may no longer make complete sense.

VARIANTS OF [MAIN PROGRAM EXECUTABLES]:

(WJS 7-1-2007: These have not been fully tested for compatability with
all of the changes of the last few months. In particular, options that
require you to specify parameter indices (e.g. sensTest) may not behave
as expected.)

(MJL 02-28-2025: as WJS comments above are, but 17+ years later!)

sipnetGirdle: A modified version of SIPNET. Its operation is controlled
by command-line arguments. WJS (7-1-2007): I have not changed this
program to stay up to date with the recent changes made to SIPNET, and
have not tested it after making these changes. Use at your own risk!

sensTestFull: sensTest as modified by John Zobitz. Its operation is
controlled by command-line arguments. WJS (7-1-2007): I have not tested
this program with the changes I have made over the last few months (in
particular, the new version of spatialParams), and thus do not guarantee
that it will work as expected. Use at your own risk!
