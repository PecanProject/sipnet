! Input file to set up a sensTest run (using 'sensTest')
! Note that you can also do a sensitivity test from within SIPNET; this
!  is controlled by sipnet.in

! Output will be put in FILENAME.senstest. Each line contains:
!  paramVal  logLikelihood

! --- FILE NAMES ---

FILENAME = niwot
! FILENAME.param is the file of parameter values and info
!  (unless PARAM_FILE is specified below)
! FILENAME.param-spatial is the file of spatially-varying parameters
!  (first line must contain a single int: # of locations)
!  (if PARAM_FILE is specified, then instead use PARAM_FILE-spatial for
!  spatially-varying parameters)
! FILENAME.clim is the file of climate data for each time step
! FILENAME.dat is the file of measured data (one column per data type)
! FILENAME.spd (steps per day) contains one line per location; each line
!  begins with year and julian day of 1st point, followed by the number
!  of steps in each day, terminated by -1
! FILENAME.valid contains fraction of valid data points for each time
!  step (one col. per data type)

PARAM_FILE = none
! If specified (not 'none'), use given file for parameter values and
!  info, rather than FILENAME.param


! --- INPUTS CONTROLLING PARAMETER CHANGES ---

CHANGE_PARAM = none
! Name of parameter to change

LOW_VAL = 0
HIGH_VAL = 1
NUM_RUNS = 10
! Parameter is varied from LOW_VAL to HIGH_VAL over a total of NUM_RUNS


! --- DATA TYPES TO INCLUDE IN MODEL-DATA COMPARISONS ---

! 1 = include in model-data comparisons; 0 = don't include
OPT_NEE = 1
OPT_EVAPOTRANSPIRATION = 0
OPT_SOIL_WETNESS = 0


! --- VARIABLES CONTROLLING MODEL-DATA COMPARISONS ---

LOC = 0
! Location to run at (can only perform a sensitivity test at a single
!  location)

VALID_FRAC = 0.5
! Fraction of data points which must be valid to use data from a given
!  time step

OPT_INDICES_EXT = none
! If not 'none', this gives the extension of the optimization indices
!  file; the full filename is FILENAME.OPT_INDICES_EXT
! File giving, for each location, start and end indices for optimization
!  (one line per location, with each line containing two integers: start
!  & end; if no file specified, use all points)
!  (1-indexing; end = -1 means go to end)

AGGREGATION_EXT = none
! If not 'none', this gives the extension of the file containing number
!  of time steps per model/data aggregation - i.e. aggregations that are
!  performed prior to doing model-data comparisons in the optimization
! The full filename is FILENAME.AGGREGATION_EXT
! Each line contains aggregation info for one location, and each line
!  is terminated with a -1
!  Each value (i) on a given line is an integer giving the number of
!  time steps in aggregation i in that time step
!  (e.g. to run model-data comparison on a yearly aggregation, each
!  value would be number of steps in year i)
!  (if no file specified, will perform no aggregation)
! Note that VALID_FRAC is ignored for aggregated data (assumed equal to
!  0)

UNAGGED_WEIGHT = 0.0
! If aggregation is done, relative weight of unaggregated points in
!  optimization (should probably be 0 or 1; 0 means only use aggregated
!  points in optimization)
