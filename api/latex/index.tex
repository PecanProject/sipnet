[Redo this once we finish code reduction changes]

Organization strategy\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SIPNET and common files each have their own directory
\item Stand-\/alone utilities all go into the {\ttfamily utilities} subdirectory
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysubsection{Main program -\/ SIPNET}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
[Add description here of SIPNET\textquotesingle{}s "{}compilation switch"{} strategy -\/ which hopefully will become command-\/line params at some point, but not yet. We need to doc the possible switches somewhere...]\doxysubsection{Stand-\/alone Utilities}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
{\bfseries{subset\+Data}}\+: A utility to subset a data record temporally. This utility can also perform daily aggregation on the data if so desired. Its operation is controlled by subset.\+in.

{\bfseries{transpose}}\+: A little utility to transpose a text file that contains a rectangular matrix of data. This may be necessary to read certain files into Excel (e.\+g. the single-\/variable output files). Its usage is \textquotesingle{}transpose filename\textquotesingle{}.
