# Contributing to SIPNET

We welcome contributions to SIPNET. This document outlines the process for contributing to the SIPNET project.

All contributors are expected to adhere to the PEcAn Project [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## GitHub Workflow

#### Branches

The `master` branch is the default branch for SIPNET. Development should be done in feature branches. Feature branches should be named to clearly indicate the purpose, and may be combined with associated issue, e.g. `ISSUE#-feature-name`.

#### Pull Requests

Pull requests should be made from feature branches to the `master` branch. 

Pull request descriptions should include a brief summary of the changes and links to related issues. 

Expectations for merging:
- Pass all unit and integration tests. 
- Approved by at least one other developer before being merged.
- Include updates and additions to 
  - Documentation
  - Tests
  - CHANGELOG.md 
  
## Style Guide

### Clang

Use Clang Format. Details TBD. See #31 <!-- add info about our use of `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` -->

### Documentation

What goes in **Doxygen**:
- Documentation for functions, classes, and parameters.

What goes in **docs/*md**:
- User guides and tutorials.
- Documentation of equations, theoretical basis, and parameters.

## Compiling SIPNET binaries

SIPNET uses `make` to build the model and documentation. There are also miscellaneous targets for running analysis workflows:

```sh
# build SIPNET executable
make sipnet
# build documentation
make document
# clean up build artifacts
make clean
# list all make commands
make help
```
## Testing

Any new features (that are worth keeping!) should be covered by tests.

SIPNET also uses `make` to build and run its unit tests. This can be done with the following commands:
```shell
# Compile tests
make test
# Run tests
make testrun
# Clean after tests are run
make testclean
```

If changes are made to the `modelStructure.h` file and unit tests are failing, try running the update script as shown below. Consider running this script even if unit tests _are not_ failing.
```shell
# Run this command from the root directory to update unit test versions of modelStructures.h
tests/update_model_structures.sh
```

## Releases

- Use [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/) for SIPNET releases.
- Tag releases with the version number `vX.Y.Z`.
- Include content from `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- Add compiled SIPNET binaries.
