Procedure for adding new Niwot data (e.g. new year):

1) Download annual data

2) Cat together all new years for each of climates, climates.flags, fluxes, and fluxes.flags

3) Run removeheaders on the 4 resulting files

4) (There is no longer a step 4)

5) (There is no longer a step 5)

6) cat new climate data, flux data with previous data

7) Separate out the following from climate file, make separate files for ea.:
	day (= floor(decimal day of year)), hourofday (= hour + minute/60), ppfd, precip, rhum, soilwetness, tair, tsoil, ustar, wdir, wspd, year

8) FOR OLD (PRE-5/13/04) CLIMFILL ONLY: Create timeday file (vector whose length is length of climate array; start at 0 and increment by 1/48 with each element)

9) Check: take head of each of these (num lines = number of steps in old climate file), diff with old files

10) Modify daylen.m for correct location and times; run it

11) For any climate data with missing values, fill missing values using climfill.m
Note: only fill values that are missing (ie NaN) - don't remove and refill values that were already filled by some algorithm in the data set.
Note: this also calculates vpress, vpd and vpdsoil (make sure it's using the right function for this)
	Optional: Check diff between filled and unfilled files - if some are the same, delete filled, make link to original (to avoid wasting disk space)
	If not already there, create link from precipfill to precip
	Multiply vpress, vpd and vpdsoil by 1000, resave

12) NEE = CO2 flux with u* filter
	Note: CO2 storage already taken into account
	Note: don't refill data - already filled
	Convert to g C * m^-2 * timestep^-1 (multiply by (12*1800/1000000))
	Save it
	If not already there, create link from neefill to nee_ustarfilt (or whatever the nee file is called)

13) neevalid = ((CO2-flag == 1) & (ustar >= 0.2))
	Note: use ustar rather than ustarfill to be more conservative
	Save it

14) FH2O = H2O flux
	Note: ignore H2O storage
	Note: don't refill data - already filled
	Convert it to cm H2O * timestep^-1 (multiply by (18*1800/(1000*10000)))
	Save it
	If not already there, create link from fh2ofill to fh2o

15) fh2ovalid = ((LE-flag == 1) & (ustar >= 0.2))
	Note: use ustar rather than ustarfill to be more conservative
	Save it 

16) Set ndays (in Matlab), run climdn, fh2odn, needn
	Divide each entry in intervaldn by 2 (convert from #steps to hours), save it

17) Run validdn for each of fh2o and nee

18) Run soilwetnessdn
	May want to first modify upperlimit
	(Outputs soilwetnessdn (in fractional soil wetness) and soilwetnessvaliddn)

19) Run sipnetClim
	Can compare new niwots.clim with old niwots.clim
	mv new niwots.clim to ~/sipnet

20) Create niwots.spd file: e.g.
	1998 305 3 2 #1885 -1
	Where:
	1998 = first year
	305 = first day
	3 = # time steps in first day
	2 = # time steps in second day
	#1885 = short-hand for 1885 2's (i.e. 2 time steps in every following day)
	-1 = terminator

21) In Matlab, set data = [fh2odns needns soilwetnessdns], save it as niwots.dat
	Set valid = [fh2ovaliddn neevaliddn soilwetnessvaliddn], save it as niwots.valid
	Check data and valid against old - basically the same?

CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE DONE! NOW RUN IT IN FORWARD MODE AND ASSIMILATION MODE!
